increase the size of the skillzza logo

from the below of second navbar we have our hero section see the ss 
also many has there own meta data so
use this data to get exact same result

the color blue should be this "#D2ECFA"

see the ss all 4 cards are not placed normally they are
placed as shown in the ss i want exactly same placement

first line 5 cards image used in 1st line is "Group 23862.png, Group 34185.png, Group 23863.png, Mask Group 30.png, Group 23839.png "

see the ss the background img is "Group 37835" the main image is "businesspeople-having-discussion-office.png"

this content color "Connect with our industry experts for a personalised consultation. Let's explore how our solutions can revolutionise your growth." should be "#414040"

purple color is "#F8EDFF", cream color is "#F4E3CC", pink or red color "#F7C9C9",
blue color "#B6DFF5", podcast background color "#1C97D4", 


whenever the number comes in the viewport then it should runs from 0 to there final value
it should runs every time not for a single time

see the ss in this see that both ends left + right are faded i want exact same fadness in this section 
for both sliders

all things are working correctly and perfectly for the bigger screens (laptop) now i want that make a proper in depth todos to make the 
whole website responsive for the smaller screen (mobile) also the main thing to keep in mind 
that implementing this should not affects the bigger screens flow you have to fully work for the 
smaller screens only do not disturb the bigger screens flow

see the ss in this the hero section not looking mobile responsive the heading is overlapped
by the navbar make it proper improve the image make its size, texts and all other things to get best look for the mobile screens
also the navbar should be come in a good smooth animations when user click to the navbar then 
hero section should remains in its fixed position and should not scroll down side make in depth todos
to make the hero section best and make sure the desktop screens flow should not affected by doing this


do whatever you want to change for the mobile screen the whole website is still not ni a mobile
responsive you can add, edit make size of images, texts change decrease do whatever you want to do so that at the end we get mobile responsive website
and make sure it should not affects the desktops responsive flow
